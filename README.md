# MemoryGame

MemoryGame is a simple memory game developed in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this game, the player gets to relive the experience of memory games in a healthful and entertaining session of game time.

A board of flipped cards is presented to you and selecting a card flips it. Flip two matching cards to score! 
The game will also actually help you throughout the process, if it notices that you have troubles memorizing.

Test your memory skills in this set of 12 cards and 6 unique card matches. Keep your memory sharp and enjoy one of the most classical games you have ever played!
